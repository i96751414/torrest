// Package broadcast implements broadcast type messaging (or event) in a Go idiomatic
// way. This is based on the design invented at [1] and the actual implementation
// from [2], modified to only expose channels, which are the prefered way of
// communicating in Go.

// The comments are orignally from the gibb package.
